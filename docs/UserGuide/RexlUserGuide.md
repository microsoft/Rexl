# Rexl User Guide

This guide documents core Rexl, not RexlScript. That is, this covers the _expression language_ and
_not_ the statement constructs available in RexlScript hosts such as Jupyter.

Each section that contains subsections starts with a bulleted list with links to the subsections.

* [About Rexl](Sections/01-AboutRexl.md)
* [Types and Values](Sections/02-TypesAndValues.md)
* [Extended Operators and Functions](Sections/03-ExtendedOperatorsAndFunctions.md)
